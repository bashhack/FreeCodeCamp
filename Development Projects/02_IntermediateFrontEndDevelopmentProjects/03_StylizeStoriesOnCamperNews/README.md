# Zipline: Stylize Stories on Camper News


## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/MarufSarker/full/ZGPZLq/.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I can browse recent posts from Camper News.

### User Story:
As a user, I can click on a post to be taken to the story's original URL.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can see how many upvotes each story has.

## Hint:
Here's the Camper News Hot Stories API endpoint: http://www.freecodecamp.com/news/hot.

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.
