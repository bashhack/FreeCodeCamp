# Zipline: Build a Wikipedia Viewer

## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/MwgQea.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, when I type in the search box, I can see a dropdown menu with autocomplete options for matching Wikipedia entries.

## Hint:
Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.
