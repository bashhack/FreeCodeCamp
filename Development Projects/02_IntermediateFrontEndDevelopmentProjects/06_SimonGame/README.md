# Zipline: Build a Simon Game

## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/dting/full/QbRyqq/.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I am presented with a random series of button presses.

### User Story:
As a user, each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

### User Story:
As a user, I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

### User Story:
As a user, if I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

### User Story:
As a user, I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, the tempo of the game speeds up incrementally on the 5th, 9th and 13th step.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

## Hint:
Here are mp3s you can use for each button: https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound1.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound2.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound3.mp3, https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound4.mp3.

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.
