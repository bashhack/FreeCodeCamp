# Zipline: Show the Local Weather

## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/avqvgJ.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I can see the weather in my current location.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can see an icon depending on the weather.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I see a different background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.
