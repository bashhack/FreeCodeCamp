# Zipline: Use the Twitchtv JSON API


## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/GJKRxZ.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

### User Story:
As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

### User Story:
As a user, if Free Code Camp is streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can search through the streams listed.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account. You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

## Hint:
See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Zipline-Use-the-Twitchtv-JSON-API.

## Hint:
The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.

## Hint:
Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream coding: ["freecodecamp", "storbeck", "terakilobyte", "habathcx","RobotCaleb","thomasballinger","noobs2ninjas","beohoff"]

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.
