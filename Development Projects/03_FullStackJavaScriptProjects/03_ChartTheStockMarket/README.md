# Basejump: Chart the Stock Market

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://stockstream.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

## Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.

## As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am "your commit message". Note that you should replace "your commit message" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.

## You can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.

## Here are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:

### User Story:
As a user, I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

### User Story:
As a user, I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

### User Story:
As a user, I can remove stocks.

### Bonus User Story:
As a user, I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.

## Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku. If you pair programmed with a friend, enter his or her Free Code Camp username as well so that you both get credit for completing it.
