# Basejump: Build a Nightlife Coordination App

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

## Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.

## As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am "your commit message". Note that you should replace "your commit message" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.

## You can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.

## Here are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:

### User Story:
As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

### Bonus User Story:
As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

## Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.

## Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku. If you pair programmed with a friend, enter his or her Free Code Camp username as well so that you both get credit for completing it.
