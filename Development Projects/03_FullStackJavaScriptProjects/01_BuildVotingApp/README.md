# Basejump: Build a Voting App

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://votingapp.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

## Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.

## As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am "your commit message". Note that you should replace "your commit message" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.

## You can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.

## Here are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

### User Story:
As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

### Bonus User Story:
As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

### Bonus User Story:
As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

### Bonus User Story:
As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

## Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku. If you pair programmed with a friend, enter his or her Free Code Camp username as well so that you both get credit for completing it.
