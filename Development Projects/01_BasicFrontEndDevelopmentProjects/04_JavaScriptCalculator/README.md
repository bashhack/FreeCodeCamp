## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/zxgaqw.

## Rule #1:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

## Rule #2:
You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

## Rule #3:
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

### User Story:
As a user, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

### Bonus User Story:
I can clear the input field with a clear button.

### Bonus User Story:
I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

## When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.

## If you'd like immediate feedback on your project from fellow campers, click this button and paste in a link to your CodePen project. ##
